## TODO
As this package was ported quickly from atom packages due to sunseting of Atom, thus this package could use some more care.
For example, it has certain dependencies that won work when upgrading them to a new version (node-fetch, js-base64)

Ability to send py code to server and retrive the response, just like the native Dynapp editor would be very usefull.

## Development

The package can be ran in VS Code to test during development.

When ready to realease, commit you changes and tag your release.
Then build/package a new .vsix file for distribution.

If this is your first time, you first need to install @vsce@.

```
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
```

The package the extension. This will create the .vsix file, named using the current version in package.json

```
vsce package
```
